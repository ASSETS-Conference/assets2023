              <p>
                To host a workshop at ASSETS, workshop organizers submitted a proposal following the <a href="workshops.html">Workshop Proposal CFP</a> in July,
                2023. These proposals were then peer reviewed by the community and selected by the Workshop Track Co-chairs, Julian
                Brinkley and Earl Huff Jr. (<a href="mailto:workshops-assets23@acm.org">workshops-assets23@acm.org</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Ultimately, four workshops were selected (listed below). To attend a workshop, please see the individual workshop
                webpages—each have their own CFPs and participation criteria.

                Are you interested in designing technology that is both accessible and privacy-aware? Join our virtual ASSETS 2023
                workshop! We aim to build community, unpack how identity afects disability and privacy, refect on potential privacy
                and
                accessibility conficts, and imagine accessible privacy-preserving solutions. We welcome submissions from research at
                the
                intersection of accessibility and privacy. We also invite submissions that center a Global South perspective. Industry
                practitioners, policy experts, and activists are especially encouraged to apply! Please submit a 500-1000 word
                position using <a

                The workshop “Tackling the Lack of a Practical Guide in Disability-Centered Research” aims to explore the opportunity to
                provide practical guidance for access(ibility) research that centers disabled people. We intend to build on insights
                from disability studies, critical access research, and disabled communities, seeking to minimize instances in which
                research is irrelevant or does harm. The overarching goal is to discuss current research approaches and develop
                practical recommendations for our research community. We invite participation from members of our community and beyond
                who want to reflect on how we engage in research, including those who are new to accessibility research. Submissions
                should be a short engagement with the topic, and could be in written format, a video, or another graphical format
                (please refer to website for details), must be accessible, and should fall into one of the three following categories:
                <ul>
                  <li>Reflective accounts of one’s own research, critically examining researcher positionality and how disabled people
                  were (not) included in the research process.</li>
                  <li>A summary of questions that you have with respect to accessibility
                  research that centers disabled people, and an indication of guidance that you would like to receive. This category is
                  particularly suited for people who are new to accessibility research.</li>
                  <li>Experience reports of research participation,
                  or instances in which participation was declined.</li>

                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                This category is open to disabled people who have previously taken
                part in (accessibility) research (or declined to do so). </p>
              <p><b>Submissions are due on September 27</b>, and can be made via email

                <li> An <em>East Coast</em> workshop will be held on Sunday the 21st of October from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm with an
                  option to join the organizers
                  for lunch afterwards. We are hoping to hold this at NYU but still need to confirm.
                </li>
                <li> A <em>West Coast</em> workshop will be held on Monday the 16th of October from 1:00 pm to 3:00 pm at the
                  University of Washington.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Please join us in envisioning the future of accessibility work. As technology has extended into new realms, so has
                our field. Accessibility research is tackling a wider variety of topic areas driven by the observation that people
                with
                disabilities are present in (and often over- or under- represented in) all of the same spaces as people without
                disabilities. In today’s world, technology is similarly present in all of those spaces; and this raises new types of
                access questions. This workshop aims to explore and develop goals for a future in which our field broadens its concept
                of relevant topics in the important work of studying and developing technology that supports and empowers people with
                disabilities.
              
              </p>
              <p>The goals of this workshop are to develop this agenda and launch a speaker series to explore these topics over the
                course of the next year. We plan to rotate the time of these talks to accommodate different time zones. We also plan
                to
                work together to write a position paper that can inspire, and empower, our community to encourage, engage in, and
                support the work of extending our field into new and under studied domains. Participation criteria will be based on
                submission of a relevant writing sample (we allow new writing, previously published formal and informal writing or
                videos). Participants can select whether accepted papers should be made public or not. You can learn more at

                Conventionally, the accessibility research community centers most of its efforts on designing assistive technologies and
                systems related to single categories of impairments. Although this approach has contributed to valuable progress and
                advancements in the field, there is a growing consensus among accessibility researchers that focusing on designing
                technologies for single impairments oversimplifies disability since this approach may fail to adequately address the
                real-world experiences of a significant population of users with complex needs. This workshop intends to challenge
                current paradigms in the accessibility field and serve as a forum for different researchers and practitioners to share
                work related to accessible technologies for users with multiple disabilities or complex needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                We invite presentation proposals from researchers and practitioners of different disciplines interested in designing
                accessible technologies with and for users with multiple disabilities or complex needs. Proposals should include a
                250-word abstract stating their existing work, new ideas, or their critical position related to challenges in designing
                technologies for users with multidimensional needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Abstracts should discuss issues or present novel ideas related to the workshop's theme. We also welcome submissions in
                the form of videos or posters. Authors must ensure the accessibility of their submission by following the SIGACCESS
                template and accessibility guidelines. Submissions can be made by September 15, 2023 by completing the proposal form
                available on the workshop website. Authors will be notified by September 22. If accepted, at least one author must
                attend the virtual workshop at ASSETS 2023 on Saturday 28 October (via Zoom).
