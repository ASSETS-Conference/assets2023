                    <h4>How do I prepare for the presentation with screen reader?</h4>
                    <p>Presenters who have accessibility needs should work with their session chair and the accessibility chair to ensure their presenting experience is accessible.
                        Every presenter should do a tech check during the break before their session. People with accessibility needs can also familiarize themselves with the presenter set-up and test accessibility provisions. For example, screen reader users can connect their computer to the projector, and adjust their computer's sound settings if they do not want their screen reader to play through the room speakers.  Plugging an external sound card into a computer running a screen reader is also a good option as it allows the user to proactively divert screen reader audio to their headphones before connecting to a projector.

                    <h4>Will sign language interpretation or captioning be available?</h4>
                    <p>The conference will provide a team of sign language interpreters or captioners for the main conference (Mon-Wed).</p>

                    <h4>What is the conference space like?</h4>
                    <p>For the overall layout of the venue, please refer to this map of the conference space.
                        The Verizon Center has 3 floors. On the first floor is a lobby with registration desk and a main event room. We will hold the sessions in the event room. The second and third floors each have a gallery and a couple of classrooms. We will have the poster sessions in the gallery and classrooms on both floors, depending on how much space we need. The DC on Sunday will be held in a classroom. The SIGACCESS business meeting will also be held in a classroom (not decided yet). Breakfast, lunches and coffee breaks will be set up buffet style in the first-floor lobby. People will be able to eat in any of the indoor spaces described above or outside. There is outdoor seating at the Graduate Hotel and the Bloomberg Center, both of which are just a few steps away.
                        For more information about wheelchair accessibility at Verizon Executive Education Center at Cornell Tech, please contact Office of Facilities Operations on (646) 971-3777 or <a href="mailto:events@tech.cornell.edu">events@tech.cornell.edu</a>

                    <h4>Can a student volunteer assist me during the conference?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Student volunteers will be available to assist attendees with disabilities with navigation, meal service, or other accessibility needs. If you will need volunteer assistance at the conference, please indicate this on your conference registration form.
                        Attendees who require personal care assistance should bring their own assistant. Please contact <a href="mailto:treasurer-assets23@acm.org">Registration Chair</a> for any issues related to assistants' or companion's registration issues.</p>
                    <h4>Can I bring my guide dog?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! Guide dogs and other service animals are welcome at ASSETS 2023. There will be a relief area with water available. We are still working on the precise location. Please indicate on your registration form if you anticipate bringing a service animal to the conference.</a>

                    <p>The Accessibility Chair for ASSETS 2023 is Jonggi Hong, Sooyeon Lee, whose goal is to ensure the conference is accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be a registration question labeled "Do you have a disability or special need which requires our awareness?". In your response, please indicate any accessibility needs such as wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, or a guide. The Accessibility Chair will follow up with you to clarify your needs.
