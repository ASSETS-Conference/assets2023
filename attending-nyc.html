              <p>
              Roosevelt Island is a narrow island located in between Manhattan and Queens on the East River. It is accessible through
              the New York City MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority) by Subway, Bus, and Aerial Tram. The MTA website provides
              detailed information about <a href="https://new.mta.info/fares">Metro Card Fares</a> and the overall <a href="https://new.mta.info/accessibility">accessibility</a> of the system. Three notable points are:
              <ul>

              <li>*Many* subway stations are not ADA accessible but all MTA buses should be</li>
              <li>The MTA has written <a href="https://new.mta.info/maps/subway-line-maps">text maps</a> of subway stations for people who cannot access map visualizations </li>
              <li>The MTA accepts contactless forms of payment at the turnstiles in train stations or fair scanners on buses; (no explicit ticket purchase required) </li>
              </ul>
              
              Other transportation options outside the MTA include ferry and car. More information about booking wheelchair accessible taxis in New York
              City can be found on the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/accessible-dispatch.page">Accessible Dispatch</a> website provided by New York Citi's Taxi and Limousine Comission. 
              Additionally, the apps Curb, Lyft, and Uber have an accessible ride option.
              </p>


              <p> 
                There is a 3.8 mile paved trail that covers the circumference of the island, and the Red Bus offers <b>FREE</b> transportation throughout convenient stops in the island between 888 Main St. and Southpoint Park. There are twelve stops, and one of them directly stops at Cornell Tech at East Loop Road. The bus can be tracked via the NEXT Bus App. Get the app via <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nyc-next-bus/id548279116?mt=8">Apple</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextbus.mobile&hl=en">Android</a> stores.

                The island is only serviced by the F Train (Orange Line), which travels from the borough of Queens to Coney Island at the southern tip of Brooklyn. The stop is ADA accessible and called  Roosevelt Island. The entrance is on W Road west of Main St, and there are elevators inside the station house on W Rd after crossing the turnstiles. The elevator on the right goes to the Manhattan-bound platform, and the elevator on the left goes to the Queens-bound platform.
              </p>

                There are many options to travel from the NYC airports to Roosevelt Island. Below we provide some of the fastest, accessible, and most affordable options. Note that the connections from JFK and Newark require purchasing tickets outside the MTA system (e.g., via a kiosk or app).

                The <a href="https://bustime.mta.info/m/?q=Q102">Q102 Bus</a>  connects Astoria (in Queens) to Roosevelt Island via a bridge that crosses the water.

This bus accepts Metro cards, but some bus stops require paying before getting on board.

              <p>
                  This Aerial tram connects the East Side of Manhattan to Roosevelt Island via a cable car that crosses the river. The tram travels 250ft off the ground and the ride takes about 3 minutes to cross the river. We highly encourage everyone that has the availability to take the Tram at least once. It is a fun way of going into Manhattan from Roosevelt Island and also from Manhattan into Roosevelt Island. The Tram entrance is located at 2nd Avenue and 60th Street on the Manhattan side, and on the Tramway Plaza East on the Roosevelt Island side. The Tram is  wheelchair accessible (via elevator) and it only accepts Metro Card (No cash, and no tap to pay).

                The NYC Ferry has a landing on Roosevelt Island that runs on the Astoria Line connecting Astoria, Long Island City, East 34th street and Pier 11/Wall street. 
                The Ferry system does not accept Metro Cards, and uses its own ticketing system. It costs $4 for a one way ride. There are kiosks at the landing where you can purchase tickets.

              <p>
                The estimated time to drive from the three airports to Roosevelt Island is:
                <li> 5.5 miles, estimated 30 minutes from LaGuardia, </li>
                <li> 16.6 miles, estimated 50 minutes from JFK, </li>
                <li> 24.7 miles, estimated 1 hour from Newark. </li> 
                
                <br>
                However, traffic in New York City is unpredictable and can be very heavy at times. We recommend to take due precautions and plan accordingly.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are many car and rideshare services that connect Roosevelt Island to major transportation hubs. The most common ones are Lyft, Uber, and Curb. If you are coming from the Newark Airport located at Jersey City, you will have to pay a toll to cross the bridge into Manhattan. The toll is $16.00 for cars and $12.50 for taxis.

                The island can be traversed on foot or on wheelchair. Many residents and people that work on Roosevelt Island commute by foot or by bike.  Bare in mind that some of the portions of the road have gaps that might make it hard to cross without a power-wheel chair. All the walkways are paved, well-kept, and have curbside ramps for wheelchair users. Description of paths / streets on the island.

                If you are interested in moving around the island on rental bike, there are three CitiBike locations. The first location is near Cornell Tech at the entrance of the South Point Park. The second location is near the firefighters baseball field, the tram station, and close to the Ferry Landing. The third location is on the North of the island at 592 Main Street.
